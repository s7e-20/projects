# node.js web app

An exercise to start learning node.js, built using this [tutorial](http://www.nodebeginner.org/).

The use cases:

- The user should be able to use our application with a web browser
- The user should see a welcome page when requesting http://domain/start which displays a file upload form
- By choosing an image file to upload and submitting the form, this image should then be uploaded to http://domain/upload, where it is displayed once the upload is finished
