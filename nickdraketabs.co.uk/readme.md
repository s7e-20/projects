## [nickdraketabs.co.uk](https://leoreeves.github.io/projects/nickdraketabs.co.uk)

Gave the [original site](http://nickdraketabs.co.uk/) a facelift using CSS, replaced much of the original HTML and made it mobile-friendly.

Built using:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Nunjucks
- Gulp

### Setup

1. Run `npm install`
2. [Install gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start/)
3. Run `gulp watch` and open `index.html` to view the site (manually refresh changes are made)
4. Run `gulp nunjucks` to output the files and commit

### Editing files

Edit the files in `src`, these will output to the main folder.
